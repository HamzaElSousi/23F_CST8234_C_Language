What is the maximum size of the array the program can handle?
- By defining a Constant/Macro. #define MAX_INPUT_SIZE 100

How does the program ensure that the user enters a valid array length?
- Input validation is performed using loops and a 'if' statement to ensure correct array length and numeric values for elements.

How does the code manage an invalid numeric input for array elements?
-
How are the three array manipulation functions implemented?
-
What is the role of the print_array function in the program?
- print_array Function: This function simply prints the array's elements enclosed within curly braces {}. 

In which part of the code does the user interact with the program to choose array operations?
-
How does the reverse_array function actually reverse the array's elements?
- reverse_array Function: This function reverses the array. It does so by swapping elements in a symmetrical manner
- starting from both ends and moving towards the center.

How is the randomization of array elements achieved in the randomize_array function?
- randomize_array Function: This function shuffles the array's elements. It uses a time function seed to dynamically
- generate random indices for swapping.

Can you explain the logic behind the sort_array function?
- sort_array Function: This function sorts the array using the insertion sort algorithm. It divides the array into a
- sorted and an unsorted region and repeatedly picks the leftmost unsorted element and moves it to its correct position
- in the sorted region.

How does the program handle invalid menu choices when selecting an array operation?

- Input validation is performed using loops to ensure correct array length and numeric values for elements.
